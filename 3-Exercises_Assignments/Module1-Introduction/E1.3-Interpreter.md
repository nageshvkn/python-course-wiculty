## üß™ Exercises - How Python creates and uses bytecode

---

#### **Step 1: Create a Simple Python Script**

Create a file called `hello.py` with this code:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello from compiled file!")

greet()
```

---

#### **Step 2: Run the Python Script Normally**

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python hello.py
```

**Output:**
```
Hello from compiled file!
```

Behind the scenes, Python also creates a `.pyc` file (bytecode) in a folder named `__pycache__`.

---

#### **Step 3: Look Inside `__pycache__`**

Check the `__pycache__` folder in your project directory.  
You will see a file like:  
```
hello.cpython-311.pyc
```
This file contains the compiled bytecode for your script.

---

#### **Step 4: Run the `.pyc` File Directly (Optional)**

You can run the bytecode file directly:

```bash
python __pycache__/hello.cpython-311.pyc
```

This will execute the bytecode and give the same output as running `hello.py`.

---

#### **Step 5: Manually Compile (Optional)**

You can also generate the `.pyc` file without running the script:

```bash
python -m py_compile hello.py
```

This command creates the same `.pyc` file in the `__pycache__/` folder.

---

#### **Bonus Tip: View the Bytecode (Advanced)**

To see the actual bytecode instructions, use:

```bash
python -m dis hello.py
```

This will display the low-level bytecode that Python generates from your script.
