## 🧪 Exercises - How Python creates and uses bytecode

---

#### **Step 1: Create a Simple Python Script**

Create a file called `hello.py` with this code:

```python
# hello.py

print("Hello, World!")
```

---

#### **Step 2: Run the Python Script Normally**

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python hello.py
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

That's how we generally run Python code.
As we discussed, Behind the scenes, Python Interpreter 1. Parses the code line by line 2. Compiles the code automatically (You can check compiled code (bytecode) in `.pyc` file in a folder named `__pycache__`). 3. Executes the code and provides the program output. 

---

#### **Step 3: Explore more about **Bytecode** just for better clarity.

Check the `__pycache__` folder in your project directory.  
You will see a file like:  
```
hello.cpython-311.pyc
```
This file contains the compiled bytecode for your script.

---

> We can also run `.pyc` bytecode file directly.
Run the `.pyc` File Directly

```bash
python __pycache__/hello.cpython-311.pyc
```

> This will execute the bytecode and give the same output as running `hello.py`.
>This is just to explore how Bytecode works. We don't run `.pyc` files. We run Python `.py` code directly.
---

#### **Step 5: Manual Compilation**

You can also generate the `.pyc` file by manually compiling `.py` file without running the script:

```bash
python -m py_compile hello.py
```

This command creates the same `.pyc` file in the `__pycache__/` folder.

---

#### **Bonus Tip: View the Bytecode (Advanced)**

To see the actual bytecode instructions, use:

```bash
python -m dis hello.py
```

This will display the low-level bytecode that Python generates from your script.
