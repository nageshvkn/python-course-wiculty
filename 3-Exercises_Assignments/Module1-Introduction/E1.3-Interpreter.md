## 🧪 Exercises - How Python creates and uses bytecode

---

#### Step 1 — Create a simple Python script 📝

Create a file called `hello.py` with this code:

```python
# hello.py

print("Hello, World!")
```

---

#### Step 2 — Run the Python script normally ▶️

Open a terminal in the folder that contains `hello.py` and run (use `python3` on modern macOS):

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

Expected output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Behind the scenes:

1. The interpreter parses your source code.
2. Python compiles the parsed code to bytecode (this is the `.pyc` cached form).
3. The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) executes the bytecode and produces the program output.

---

#### Step 3 — Generate and inspect the compiled bytecode 🔧

To generate a `.pyc` file explicitly, use:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile hello.py
```

This writes the compiled bytecode into `__pycache__/`.

List the cache to confirm a `.pyc` was created:

```bash
ls -l __pycache__
# Example output:
# -rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  1234 Oct 11 12:00 hello.cpython-3xx.pyc
```

View the bytecode instructions

To see the low-level bytecode instructions Python generates, use the `dis` module:

```bash
python3 -m dis hello.py
```

Quick note: `dis` prints the opcode-level instructions (e.g., LOAD_CONST, LOAD_NAME, CALL_FUNCTION). The output is intentionally low-level and useful when you want to demonstrate how Python executes code.

---

#### Bonus — Import method (optional) 🔁

Importing a module from another script or REPL also causes Python to write its `.pyc` to `__pycache__`. Example:

```python
# run_import.py
import hello
```

Run:

```bash
python3 run_import.py
```

> 🔁 Now check `.pyc` under `__pycache__` folder.

---

## 📝 Note

- 🔎 If you don't see a `.pyc` file: make sure you ran the command from the same directory as `hello.py` (Python writes `__pycache__` next to the source). Also check that bytecode writing isn't disabled — `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE` should be unset and Python should not have been started with `-B`. Finally, confirm the process had permission to create files in that directory.
- 🧾 The `.pyc` filename contains the interpreter and version (for example `hello.cpython-311.pyc`), so the exact filename depends on your Python build/version.
