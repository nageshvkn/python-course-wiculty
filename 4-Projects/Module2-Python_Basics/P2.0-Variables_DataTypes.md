# Student Profile Generator

# Taking inputs from user
name = input("Enter your name: ")

college = input("Enter your college: ")
subjects_input = input("Enter your subjects (comma-separated): ")

# Converting the comma-separated subjects into a list
subjects = [subject.strip() for subject in subjects_input.split(",")]

# Printing the student profile

print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"College: {college}")
