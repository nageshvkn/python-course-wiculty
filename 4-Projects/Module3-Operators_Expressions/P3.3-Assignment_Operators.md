## 📘 Mini Project-1: Student Grade Calculato

### 📌 Description:
Build a grade calculator that uses assignment operators to update scores and compute final grades.
🔧 Requirements:
- Start with total_score = 0
- Add scores from 3 subjects using +=
- Apply bonus points using +=
- Apply penalty using -=
- Multiply final score by weightage using *=
- Floor divide to normalize using //=

---

## 🧱 Solution:
```python
# Initial score
total_score = 0

# Subject scores
math = 85
science = 90
english = 80

# Update total using assignment operators
total_score += math
total_score += science
total_score += english
```
---

```python
# Bonus and penalty
total_score += 10   # Bonus
total_score -= 5    # Penalty

# Weightage and normalization
total_score *= 1.1
total_score //= 1

print("Final Grade Score:", total_score)
```
