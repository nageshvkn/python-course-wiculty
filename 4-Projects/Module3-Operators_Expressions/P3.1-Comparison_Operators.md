## 📘 Mini Project: Access Control System

### 🎯 Objective
Build a console-based system to check if a user is allowed access based on age and a PIN.

### 🎯 Program Logic
- Ask for name, age, and PIN
- If age >= 18 and PIN == 1234, allow access
- Else, deny with appropriate reason

---

### 🎯 Solution

```python
def main():
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    pin = int(input("Enter access PIN: "))

    if age >= 18 and pin == 1234:
        print(f"✅ Access granted. Welcome, {name}!")
    elif age < 18:
        print("❌ Access denied. Must be at least 18.")
    elif pin != 1234:
        print("❌ Invalid PIN. Access denied.")
    else:
        print("❌ Access denied.")

main()
```
