## 🔨 Projects - Operator Precedence and Associativity

---

## 🧩 Project: Expression Evaluator

### 🎯 Objective
Build a program that:
- Accepts a mathematical expression from the user
- Evaluates it using Python’s precedence rules
- Explains which operations were performed first

---

## ✅ Solution:
```python
"""
🎯 Mini Project: Expression Evaluator

This program takes a user input expression and evaluates it.
It also explains operator precedence and shows intermediate steps.
"""

# 🧑‍💻 Input
expression = input("Enter a mathematical expression (e.g., 10 + 2 * 3): ")

# 🧠 Type casting not needed—input is a string
# ⚙️ Uses eval() to evaluate expressions with precedence
result = eval(expression)

# ✅ Output
print("Result:", result)

# 🧠 Note: eval() uses Python's operator precedence internally
print("✅ Evaluated using Python's operator precedence rules.")
```
