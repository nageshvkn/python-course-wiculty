## 🔨 Projects - Membership Operators

---

## 📘 Project-1: Student Profile Generator

### 📌 Description:
Create a simple system to check if a user is a valid member of the library and what books they can borrow.

### 📌 Solution:
```python
"""
This script checks if a user is a registered member of the library and whether a book is available for borrowing.
Demonstrates: input/output, type casting, membership operators, comments, and docstrings.
"""

# Predefined list of registered members and available books
registered_members = ["nagesh", "sneha", "arjun", "megha"]
available_books = ["python basics", "ml with python", "devops handbook", "data science 101"]

# Step 1: Take user input for name and desired book
user_name = input("Enter your name: ").strip().lower()  # normalize name for matching
book_name = input("Enter the book you want to borrow: ").strip().lower()

# Step 2: Check membership using 'in' operator
if user_name in registered_members:
    print(f"✅ Hello {user_name.title()}, you are a registered member.")

    # Step 3: Check book availability
    if book_name in available_books:
        print(f"📚 The book '{book_name.title()}' is available. You may borrow it.")
    else:
        print(f"❌ Sorry, the book '{book_name.title()}' is not available right now.")
else:
    print(f"⚠️ Sorry, {user_name.title()} is not a registered member. Please register first.")

# Step 4: Bonus - Suggestion if book not available
if book_name not in available_books:
    print("\n📖 Here are some available books you might be interested in:")
    for book in available_books:
        print(f" - {book.title()}")
```

## 📘 Project-2: Keyword-Based Content Filter
```python
"""
This program simulates a basic content moderation system.
It checks if a user's message contains any banned keywords and flags it accordingly.

Concepts used:
- Membership operators (`in`, `not in`)
- Input/output functions (`input()`, `print()`)
- Type casting (`str()`)
- Comments and docstrings for clarity
"""

# 🚫 List of banned keywords
banned_keywords = ["spam", "scam", "fake", "clickbait"]

# 🧑‍💻 Input: Get user message
message = input("Enter your message: ").strip().lower()

# 🧠 Type casting for clarity
message = str(message)

# 🔍 Membership check: Scan for banned keywords
flagged = False
for keyword in banned_keywords:
    if keyword in message:
        flagged = True
        print(f"⚠️ Message contains banned keyword: '{keyword}'")

# ✅ Final output
if flagged:
    print("❌ Message flagged for moderation.")
else:
    print("✅ Message is clean and approved.")
```
