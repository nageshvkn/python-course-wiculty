## 📘 Mini Project-1: Quiz Eligibility Checker

### 🎯 Objective
Create a program that checks if a student is eligible to take an online quiz based on:

- Logged in ✅
- Score in previous quiz >= 70 ✅
- Not blocked ❌

---

### 🎯 Solution

```python
is_logged_in = True
previous_score = 75
is_blocked = False

if is_logged_in and previous_score >= 70 and not is_blocked:
    print("You can take the quiz!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you're not eligible.")
```

## 📘 Mini Project-2: Discount Eligibility Checker

### 🎯 Objective
A store offers a discount if:
- The customer is a member or
- The purchase amount is above ₹1000
- Write a program to check discount eligibility.

## 📘 Mini Project-3: Login & Access Control System

### 🎯 Objective

Design a Python-based login and access control system using logical operators.  
The system should:

- Authenticate users based on username and password
- Check email verification and subscription status
- Grant or restrict access to premium content accordingly
- Offer alternate access via a free pass using `or` logic

This project helps students understand how logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) are used in real-world applications like authentication, authorization, and feature gating.

### 🎯 Solution

```python
# 🧑‍💻 User details
username = "nagesh"
password = "wiculty123"
is_email_verified = True
is_subscribed = False

# 🔐 Login input (simulate user input)
input_username = "nagesh"
input_password = "wiculty123"

# ✅ Check login
is_logged_in = input_username == username and input_password == password
print("Login successful?", is_logged_in)
```
---
```python
# 🔒 Access control using logical operators
if is_logged_in and is_email_verified and is_subscribed:
    print("✅ Access granted to premium content!")

elif is_logged_in and is_email_verified and not is_subscribed:
    print("⚠️ You need a subscription to access premium content.")

elif is_logged_in and not is_email_verified:
    print("⚠️ Please verify your email to proceed.")

else:
    print("❌ Invalid login. Access denied.")
```
---
```python
# 🎟️ Example using 'or' (alternate free access condition)
has_free_pass = True

if is_logged_in and (is_subscribed or has_free_pass):
    print("🎉 You can still access some content via a free pass!")
```
