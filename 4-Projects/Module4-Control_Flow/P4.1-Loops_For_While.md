## 🧩 Mini Project-2: Word Frequency Counter

### 📋 Problem Statement
Count how many times each word occurs in a sentence

### 🎯 Requirements
> 📌 Concepts Used: for loop, string split, list/set, word count.

---

### ✅ Solution:
```python
"""
📘 Count how many times each word occurs in a sentence
"""

# Input sentence
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

# Convert to list of words
words = sentence.split()

# Unique words
unique_words = list(set(words))

# Count using for loop
for word in unique_words:
    count = words.count(word)
    print(f"{word}: {count} times")
```

## 🧩 Mini Project-1:  🔐 ATM Simulator

### 📋 Problem Statement
Simulate a simple ATM machine where the user logs in with a PIN and then performs actions like checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing.

### 🎯 Concepts covered
- while loop
- if-elif-else
- input/output
- type casting
- string formatting
- break statement

---

### ✅ Solution:

```python
"""
ATM Simulator
Author: 🧑‍💻 Your Name
"""

pin = "1234"
balance = 5000.0
attempts = 0

while attempts < 3:
    user_pin = input("Enter your 4-digit PIN: ")
    if user_pin == pin:
        print("✅ Login successful!\n")
        while True:
            print("1. Check Balance")
            print("2. Deposit")
            print("3. Withdraw")
            print("4. Exit")
            choice = input("Choose an option: ")
            
            if choice == '1':
                print(f"💰 Your balance is ₹{balance}\n")
            elif choice == '2':
                amount = float(input("Enter amount to deposit: "))
                balance += amount
                print(f"✅ Deposited ₹{amount}. New balance: ₹{balance}\n")
            elif choice == '3':
                amount = float(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
                if amount <= balance:
                    balance -= amount
                    print(f"💸 Withdrawn ₹{amount}. New balance: ₹{balance}\n")
                else:
                    print("❌ Insufficient balance!\n")
            elif choice == '4':
                print("👋 Thank you for using ATM. Goodbye!")
                break
            else:
                print("❗ Invalid option. Try again.\n")
        break
    else:
        attempts += 1
        print("❌ Incorrect PIN. Try again.\n")

if attempts == 3:
    print("🚫 Too many failed attempts. Account locked.")
