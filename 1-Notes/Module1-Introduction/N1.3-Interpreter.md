## üß† Python Interpreter

### üß† Python Interpreter Architecture

It includes multiple components that work together to execute Python code:

- **Parser:**  
  Reads the code line by line and checks if your code is written correctly following Python's syntax rules (detects syntax errors).

- **Compiler:**  
  Converts the parsed code into bytecode (from `.py` to `.pyc`), which is a lower-level, platform-independent representation, also called as machine executable code.

- **Python Virtual Machine (PVM):**  
  Takes the bytecode and executes it. This is where the actual logic runs, line by line.
  And finally you get the output of the program.

### So, What is an Interpreter?

- The interpreter is like the whole machine running your Python code from start to finish.
- It's the overall system that reads the code, compiles the code, and executes the code.

#### What happens when you run a Python program? OR How Python Interpreter Works?

2. The **Python interpreter reads your code line by line** and runs it directly.
3. Behind the scenes, Python **automatically compiles your code into bytecode** (a simpler internal step).
4. This bytecode is then run by the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**.

### üÜö Compiled vs Interpreted Programming Languages

Let's understand the basic difference:

#### ‚úÖ Compiled Languages (e.g., Java):
- Code is first **compiled into bytecode** using a compiler (Separately).
- This bytecode is then run by the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** when you execute the program.
- So, Java has a **separate compilation step** before execution.

#### ‚úÖ Interpreted Languages (e.g., Python):
- Code is **read and executed line by line** directly by an interpreter.
- You don‚Äôt need a separate compilation step ‚Äî just run the program directly.

---

### üêç Is Python a Compiled or Interpreted Language?

- **Python is mainly an interpreted language.**
- Because, compilation is **automatic** and happens in the background (unlike Java, you don't compile the code manually). So, we call Python as an **interpreted language** from a user's point of view.

---

### ‚úÖ Note

- Python Interpreter also compiles the code. But it happens internally. In case of Compiled programig languages like Java, we need to separately compile the program befoe execution. So, as we don't separately compile the code, we call Python as Interpreted programming language.

### üß© What is Bytecode?

- **Bytecode** is a platform-independent version of your program.
- It is not specific to any one computer or operating system.
- This bytecode can be **executed on any machine** that has the right virtual machine (like Python‚Äôs PVM).
- It makes your code **portable and easy to run across different platforms**.
