## 🧠 Python Interpreter Architecture

It includes multiple components that work together to execute Python code:

- **Parser:**  
  Reads the code line by line and checks if your code is written correctly following Python's syntax rules (detects syntax errors).

- **Compiler:**  
  Converts the parsed code into bytecode (from `.py` to `.pyc`), which is a lower-level, platform-independent representation, also called as machine executable code.

- **Python Virtual Machine (PVM):**  
  Takes the bytecode and executes it. This is where the actual logic runs, line by line.  
  And finally you get the output of the program.

## So, What is an Interpreter?

- The interpreter is like the whole machine running your Python code from start to finish.
- It's the overall system that reads the code, compiles the code, and executes the code.

## What happens when you run a Python program? OR How Python Interpreter Works?

1. The **Python interpreter reads your code line by line** and runs it directly.  
2. Behind the scenes, Python **automatically compiles your code into bytecode** (a simpler internal step).  
3. This bytecode is then run by the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**.

## 🆚 Compiled vs Interpreted Programming Languages

Let’s understand the basic difference:

---

<a id="compiled-languages-eg-java"></a>
### ✅ Compiled Languages (e.g., Java)

- The source code is **first compiled into bytecode** by a compiler as a separate step.
- This **compiled bytecode** is then run by the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.
- Java code is **compiled during development or build time**, before it can be executed.
- Requires a **separate compilation step before running** the program, meaning you can't execute the Java source code directly.

---

<a id="interpreted-languages-eg-python"></a>
### ✅ Interpreted Languages (e.g., Python)

- Python code is **executed directly line by line** by an interpreter.
- Python code is **not compiled in advance** — it's interpreted **at runtime**, and compilation happens internally.
- **No separate compilation step** is needed — you can **run the Python code directly**.

## 🐍 Is Python a Compiled or Interpreted Language?

- **Python is mainly an interpreted language.**
- Because compilation is **automatic** and happens in the background (unlike Java, you don't compile the code manually), Python is considered an **interpreted language** from a user's point of view.

## ✅ Note

- While Python is called an interpreted language, it actually performs **compilation internally**.
- The Python interpreter first **compiles the code to bytecode**, but this step is hidden from the user.
- In contrast, languages like Java require the programmer to **explicitly compile** the code before execution.
- 🔁 Therefore, since Python doesn't require a separate compilation step, it is commonly referred to as an **interpreted language**.
- However, in loose terms, Python is often described as **both compiled and interpreted**, because the source code is **compiled to bytecode**, which is then **interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)** at runtime.

<a id="what-is-bytecode"></a>
## 🧩 What is Bytecode?

- **Bytecode** is a platform-independent version of your program.
- It is not specific to any one computer or operating system.
- This bytecode can be **executed on any machine** that has the right virtual machine (like Python’s PVM).
- It makes your code **portable and easy to run across different platforms**.
- In other words, It is this Bytecode which makes Python cross platform programming language. Meaning, same code runs on any computer or operating system like Windows, Linux, Mac ..etc.
