print("Hello, World!")
```

### 🔍 Explanation:

- `print()` is a **built-in Python function** that displays output.
- `"Hello, World!"` is a **string** (text inside quotes).
- The `#` symbol is used for **comments** — lines ignored by Python.

## 🧠 Bonus Tip – Try Python in Interactive Mode

You can also run Python directly in your terminal:

```bash
python
```

Then type:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This is called **interactive mode**, useful for quick testing.
