# 🔤 Comments and Docstrings

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose and types of comments in Python.
- Learn how to use single-line and multi-line comments.
- Explore docstrings and their importance in documenting functions, classes, and modules.
- Write clear, meaningful documentation using Python's built-in tools.

---

### 📝 What Are Comments?

Comments are human-readable lines or annotations in your code that the Python interpreter ignores. They explain intent, clarify complex logic, and mark sections for future work.

- Single‐line comments start with `#`
- Inline comments follow code on the same line, also prefixed by `#`
- “Multi‐line” comments can be simulated with consecutive single‐line comments or with triple‐quoted strings (though the latter become docstrings when placed at the top of a block)

#### ✅ Why Use Comments?
- Explain “why” rather than “what”
- Leave TODOs or FIXMEs
- Temporarily disable code during debugging

#### ✅ Best Practices
- Keep comments concise and up to date
- Don’t state the obvious (avoid `# increment i by 1` for `i += 1`)
- Use `# TODO:` and `# FIXME:` tags for task tracking

---

### 🗒️ What Are Docstrings?

Docstrings (documentation strings) are special comments that document modules, classes, functions, and methods. They’re accessible at runtime via `__doc__` or the built‐in `help()` function.

- Enclosed in triple quotes: `""" ... """` or `''' ... '''`
- Placed as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method

#### ✅ Docstring Conventions

| Style          | Usage                                  | Example                                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| One‐liner      | Simple summary                         | `"""Return factorial of n."""`                           |
| Multi‐line     | Summary + more detail                  | ```"""Compute factorial.  <BLANKLINE> Args: n (int): …"""``` |
| Sections       | Describe parameters, returns, raises   | ```"""Args: x (int): … Returns: bool: … Raises: ValueError"""``` |

### 1. Single‐Line and Inline Comments
> 👀 **Just Observe:** Don’t worry about understanding the code right now. Just focus on how Single-Line and Inline Comments are written

```python
# Calculate the sum of a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
total = 0  # accumulator

for n in numbers:
    total += n  # add each number to total

print(total)
```

### 2. Simulated Multi‐Line Comment
> 👀 **Just Observe:** Don’t worry about understanding the code right now. Just focus on how Multi-Line Comments are written

```python
# This function checks if a number is prime.
# It returns True for prime numbers,
# and False otherwise.
```

### 3. Function Docstrings
> 👀 **Just Observe:** Don’t worry about understanding the code right now. Just focus on how the **docstring (the multi-line comment inside triple quotes)** is written inside the function.

```python
def greet(name):
    """
    This function takes a name as input
    and prints a greeting message.
    """
    print("Hello,", name)
```

### 4. Class Docstrings
> 👀 **Just Observe:** Don’t worry about understanding the code right now. Just focus on how the **docstring (the multi-line comment inside triple quotes)** is written inside the Class.

```python
class Person:
    """
    A class to represent a person.

    Attributes:
    name (str): The person's name.
    age (int): The person's age.
    """

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

### 5. Module Docstrings
> 👀 **Just Observe:** Don’t worry about understanding the code right now. Just focus on how the **docstring (the multi-line comment inside triple quotes)** is written inside the Module.

```python
"""
math_utils.py

A collection of simple mathematical utilities.

Functions:
    add(a, b): Return the sum of a and b.
    multiply(a, b): Return the product of a and b.
"""
def add(a, b):
    """Return the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    """Return the product of two numbers."""
    return a * b
```

### 🧠 Summary
- Use # for single-line comments.
- Use triple quotes (""" or ''') for docstrings.
- Use help() to display documentation.
- Keep your code readable, maintainable, and professional with good commenting and documentation habits.
