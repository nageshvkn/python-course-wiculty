# 🔤 Keywords and Identifiers

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand what **keywords** are in Python.
- Know the rules and conventions for **identifiers** (variable/function/class names).
- Learn **how Python treats naming**, case sensitivity, and reserved words.
- Practice with examples, exercises, and a mini project.

---

### 📘 1. What are Keywords?

**Keywords** are special reserved words in Python that have predefined meanings.
You cannot use them as variable names, function names, or any other user defined identifiers.

These words define the syntax and structure of Python.

---

#### ✅ Properties of Keywords

| Property          | Description                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Reserved          | Cannot be used as identifiers                  |
| Case-sensitive    | `True` is valid; `true` is not a keyword       |
| Fixed by language | You cannot redefine or modify them             |
| Purposeful        | Used to define control flow, functions, etc.   |

**Example:**

```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```

---
### ✅ Examples of Keywords

As of Python 3.11, Python has **36 keywords** including:

`and`, `as`, `assert`, `break`, `class`, `continue`, `def`, `del`, `elif`, `else`, `except`, `False`, `finally`, `for`, `from`, `global`, `if`, `import`, `in`, `is`, `lambda`, `None`, `nonlocal`, `not`, `or`, `pass`, `raise`, `return`, `True`, `try`, `while`, `with`, `yield`, `match`, `case`

---

### 🧪 Code Example
```python
if = 5  # ❌ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

✅ Correct Usage:
```python
value = 5
if value > 3:
    print("Greater than 3")
```

---

### 📘 2. What are Identifiers?

**Identifiers** are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, and objects.

### ✅ Rules for Naming Identifiers

| Rule                                      | Example           | Valid |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Must start with a letter or underscore    | `_data`, `x1`     | ✅    |
| Followed by letters, digits, or underscore| `count_2`, `a3`   | ✅    |
| Cannot be a Python keyword                | `for`, `import`   | ❌    |
| Case-sensitive                            | `Data` ≠ `data`   | ✅    |
| No special characters                     | `@val`, `val#`    | ❌    |

### 🧪 Code Example
```python
studentName = "Nagesh"
StudentName = "Rao"

print(studentName)     # Nagesh
print(StudentName)     # Rao
```

---

### 🧠 Good Identifier Naming Tips

- ✅ Use meaningful names: `total_price`, `is_valid`
- ✅ Define constants in ALL CAPS: MAX_SPEED
- ✅ Use `snake_case` for variables and functions - calculate_total()
- ✅ Use `PascalCase / CamelCase` for class names: `StudentProfile`

---

### 🛠️ Example Code: Identifiers and Keywords

```python
# Using identifiers and keywords correctly
def greet_user(name):
    if name:
        print("Hello,", name)
    else:
        print("Hello, stranger!")

greet_user("Nageswara")
```
---

### 🧠 Summary

- **Keywords** are reserved by Python and cannot be used as variable or function names.
- **Identifiers** are names we give to variables, functions, classes, etc.
- Follow **naming rules and conventions** to avoid syntax errors and improve readability.
- Practice helps you become confident in naming and writing cleaner Python code.
