# üî§ Type Casting in Python

---

### üéØ Learning Objectives
- Understand what type casting is and why it is used.
- Differentiate between implicit and explicit type casting.
- Learn how to convert data types using built-in Python functions.
- Explore common use cases and potential pitfalls.
- Practice with code examples and exercises.
- Apply understanding with a mini project.

---

### üìò 1. What is Type Casting?

**Type casting** is the process of converting the value of one data type to another. It is used when you want to perform operations that require matching data types.

For example, converting a string `"10"` into an integer `10`, or an integer `5` into a float `5.0`.

### üîÑ 2. Types of Type Casting

- ‚úÖ 1. **Implicit Type Casting**: Automatically performed by Python.
- ‚úÖ 2. **Explicit Type Casting**: Manually done by the programmer using built-in functions.


#### ‚úÖ 1. Implicit Type Casting (Also called as 'Type Coercion')

Python automatically converts one data type to another when it makes sense to do so.

#### Example-1: Integer to Float
In this case, Python implicitly casts the integer `a` to float for addition.

```python
a = 5      # int
b = 2.0    # float
c = a + b  # int + float => float
print(c)   # Output: 7.0
print(type(c))  # <class 'float'>
```

#### Example-2: Boolean to Integer
In this case Python implicitly casts the Boolean `a` to Integer for addition.

```python
a = True    # treated as 1
b = 5

result = a + b  # True is implicitly cast to 1
print(result)   # 6
print(type(result))  # <class 'int'>
```

> üö´ Important Notes
> - Python always promotes types to avoid loss of data.
> - There is no implicit conversion from float to int (you‚Äôd need to do that explicitly).

#### ‚úÖ Common Implicit Conversions

| From   | To      | Example             |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| `int`  | `float` | `10 + 2.5 ‚Üí 12.5`   |
| `bool` | `int`   | `True ‚Üí 1`, `False ‚Üí 0` |
| `int`  | `complex` | `5 ‚Üí (5+0j)`     |

---

#### ‚úÖ 2. Explicit Type Casting (Also called as 'Type Conversion')

Manual conversion of one data type to another using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.

#### Syntax:
```python
int(x)     # Converts x to integer
float(x)   # Converts x to float
str(x)     # Converts x to string
bool(x)    # Converts x to boolean
```

#### Example-1: String to Integer
In this case the string value of `x` is explicitly converted as int.

```python
x = "100"
y = int(x)   # Explicit conversion
print(y + 50)  # Output: 150
```

#### Example-2: String to Integer
In this case `x` is a string. But, not a valid number. So, int(x) will throw "ValueError:".
> üö´ Note: The string must contain a valid number, or you'll get a ValueError.

```python
x = "abc"
y = int(x)   # ValueError: invalid literal for int()
```

#### Example-3: Float to Integer
In this case, the float value of `a` is explicitly converted to an integer using the int() function.
> üö´ Note the data loss: the decimal part is truncated, not rounded.

```python
a = 7.8
b = int(a)  # explicitly cast float to int (truncates decimal)
print(b)    # 7
```

#### Example-4: Integer to String
Ths value of `num` which is a Number is converted to String explicitly

```python
num = 123
text = str(num)
print(text)         # "123"
print(type(text))   # <class 'str'>
```

### Example 5: Boolean Casting
```python
print(bool(0))     # False
print(bool(1))     # True
print(bool(""))    # False
print(bool("Hi"))  # True
```

#### ‚úÖ Common Explicit Type Casting Functions

| Function         | Converts To | Example           | Result     |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| `int("5")`       | Integer     | `int("5")`        | `5`        |
| `float("3.14")`  | Float       | `float("3.14")`   | `3.14`     |
| `str(100)`       | String      | `str(100)`        | `"100"`    |
| `bool("")`       | Boolean     | `bool("")`        | `False`    |
| `bool("Hi")`     | Boolean     | `bool("Hi")`      | `True`     |
| `complex(4)`     | Complex     | `complex(4)`      | `(4+0j)`    |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Common Pitfalls in Type Casting

- Not all conversions are possible.
- You may get runtime errors if the string isn't a valid number:
```python
x = "abc"
y = int(x)  # ValueError: invalid literal for int()
```

- Casting a float to int truncates the decimal part:
```python
print(int(9.99))  # Output: 9
```
---

### üß† 4. Summary

- Type casting allows data to be converted from one type to another.
- Implicit casting is done automatically by Python.
- Explicit casting requires built-in functions.
- Always validate and handle exceptions while converting user inputs.

### üí° 5. Think Deeper
1. What‚Äôs the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?
2. What does `int("3.14")` return? Why?
3. Why is `bool("")` false but `bool("0")` true?
4. Write code to convert "55.5" (string) to integer safely.
5. Why does int("3.14") fail while float("3.14") succeeds?
6. Why does bool("False") evaluate to True?

Happy Coding! üöÄ
