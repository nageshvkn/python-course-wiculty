### 🔤 Variables and Data Types

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Grasp how Python variables reference data in memory.
- Distinguish between built-in data types and their practical use-cases.
- Solidify learning with theory, code examples, exercises, and a mini-project.


# 📌 What is a Variable?
- A **variable** in Python is a name that refers to a value stored in memory.
- A **variable** is a name used to store data in memory.
- Think of it as a container or a label to hold some data that you want to use later in your program.

```python
x = 10              ┌───────────────┐
name = "Alice"      │   Memory      │
                    │───────────────│
                    │   10          │◄─── x
                    └───────────────┘   
```

---

### 📦 Multiple Names for the Same Value

Python allows multiple variables to point to the same value:

```
a = 10
b = a

a ───► 10 ◄─── b
```

- Now both a and b refer to the same memory object (the integer 10).
- If b is reassigned later (e.g., b = 15), only the reference changes — it doesn’t affect a.

---

### 💡 Simple Analogy

Think of your computer’s memory as a big storage room full of boxes.
Each box holds some data (a number, text, etc.), and each variable name is a label that you stick on one of these boxes.

If you reassign the variable, you’re just moving the label to another box.

---



### 💡 Rules for Naming Variables:
- Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_)
- Can have letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case-sensitive (age, Age, AGE are different)
- Cannot use Python keywords (like `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.)

### ✅ Valid Variables:
```python
age = 25
first_name = "John"
_total = 100
```

### ❌ # Invalid variable names:
```python
2nd_name = "Tom"      # Starts with number
first name = "Tom"     # Has a space
class = "Physics"      # Uses a keyword
```

### 📊 Data Types in Python

Python is dynamically typed, so you don’t need to declare the type of variable explicitly.

### 🧱 Built-in Data Types:
| Type        | Example           | Description                      |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| int         | `10`              | Whole numbers                    |
| float       | `3.14`            | Decimal numbers                  |
| str         | `'Hello'`         | Textual data (strings)           |
| bool        | `True`, `False`   | Boolean values                   |
| list        | `[1, 2, 3]`       | Ordered, mutable collection      |
| tuple       | `(1, 2, 3)`       | Ordered, immutable collection    |
| dict        | `{'a': 1}`        | Key-value pairs                  |
| set         | `{1, 2, 3}`       | Unordered, unique values         |
| NoneType    | `None`            | Represents no value              |

### 🔍 Code Examples by Data Type

```python
# Integer
a = 100

# Float
pi = 3.1415

# String
language = "Python"

# Boolean
is_active = False

# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

# Tuple
point = (10, 20)

# Dictionary
student = {"name": "Raj", "age": 21, "grade": "A"}

# Set
unique_nums = {1, 2, 3, 2}

# NoneType
result = None
```

## 🧩 Everything in Python is an Object

In Python, everything you work with — numbers, strings, lists, functions, even modules — are all objects.
An object in Python is a **chunk of data** stored in memory that also carries information about:

- Its value
- Its type (class)
- Its unique identity (memory address)
- And often, its behavior (methods)

### 🧠 Analogy

Imagine every object as a box that contains:

- Data (value)
- A label describing what kind of box it is (type)
- A unique ID (its identity)

### 🧾 Example 1: Numbers

```python
x = 10
```
Here’s what happens:

- A Python object is created to represent the number 10.
- This object belongs to the class int.
- The variable x just points to this object.

```python
So behind the scenes:

x ───► [ value: 10 | type: int | id: 140928475 ]
```

### 🧾 Example 2: Strings
```python
name = "Rao"
```

This creates a string object in memory.

```python
name ───► [ value: "Rao" | type: str | id: 1902356 ]
```

You can even check these:
```python
print(type(name))  # <class 'str'>
print(id(name))    # some unique number (memory address)
```

---
### 🧱 Key Properties of Every Object

| Property  | Function                  | Example                      |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Type**  | What kind of object it is | `type(10)` → `<class 'int'>` |
| **ID**    | Unique identity in memory | `id(10)` → `123456789`       |
| **Value** | The actual data           | The number `10`              |

---

### 💡 Think of It Like This

Python sees everything as an object:

“If it has a type, you can call methods on it, and it lives in memory — it’s an object.”

That’s why you can do:

```python
x = "Rao"
print(x.upper())  # RAO
```

Here, x is not just a text — it’s a string object with built-in behavior (methods like .upper(), .lower(), etc.)

---

### 🔁 Type Checking and Type Conversion

### 🔍 Checking Type:
Use `type()` function:
```python
a = 10
print(type(a))     # Output: <class 'int'>
```

### 🔁 Type Conversion (Type Casting):
```python
x = 5
print(float(x))    # Converts int to float => 5.0

y = "123"
print(int(y))      # Converts string to int => 123
```

---

### Example 2: Changing Data Types
```python
x = 100
print(type(x))

x = "Now I'm a string"
print(type(x))
```

### Example 3: List, Tuple, Dict, Set
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 2}

print(my_list, my_tuple, my_dict, my_set)
```
---

### 📗 Common Operations by Type

```python
# String concatenation and repetition
greeting = "Hi " + "there!"
repeat = "Python " * 3

# Math with int and float
x = 5 + 2.5

# Boolean logic
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)  # False

# List operations
colors = ["red", "blue"]
colors.append("green")

# Dictionary access
profile = {"name": "Sara"}
print(profile["name"])

# Set usage
ids = {1, 2, 3}
ids.add(4)
```

### 🧠 Summary
- Variables are containers for storing data values.
- Python has multiple built-in data types.
- You can check and convert data types using built-in functions like `type()`, `int()`, `float()`, etc.

---
### 🚀 Advanced
### 💡 Check the memory location of a Variable
Use `id()` to check a variable’s memory location:

```python
x = 10
print(id(x))
```
---

## 💡 Think Deeper
- What happens under the hood when you do `a = b = [1,2,3]`?
