### 🔤 Variables and Data Types

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Grasp how Python variables reference data in memory.
- Distinguish between built-in data types and their practical use-cases.
- Solidify learning with theory, code examples, exercises, and a mini-project.


# 📌 What is a Variable?
- A **variable** in Python is a name that refers to a value stored in memory.
- A **variable** is a name used to store data in memory.
- Think of it as a container or a label to hold some data that you want to use later in your program.

```python
x = 10
name = "Alice"
```

### 💡 Rules for Naming Variables:
- Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_)
- Can have letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case-sensitive (age, Age, AGE are different)
- Cannot use Python keywords (like `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.)

### ✅ Valid Variables:
```python
age = 25
first_name = "John"
_total = 100
```

### ❌ # Invalid variable names:
```python
2nd_name = "Tom"      # Starts with number
first name = "Tom"     # Has a space
class = "Physics"      # Uses a keyword
```

### 📊 Data Types in Python

Python is dynamically typed, so you don’t need to declare the type of variable explicitly.

### 🧱 Built-in Data Types:
| Type        | Example           | Description                      |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| int         | `10`              | Whole numbers                    |
| float       | `3.14`            | Decimal numbers                  |
| str         | `'Hello'`         | Textual data (strings)           |
| bool        | `True`, `False`   | Boolean values                   |
| list        | `[1, 2, 3]`       | Ordered, mutable collection      |
| tuple       | `(1, 2, 3)`       | Ordered, immutable collection    |
| dict        | `{'a': 1}`        | Key-value pairs                  |
| set         | `{1, 2, 3}`       | Unordered, unique values         |
| NoneType    | `None`            | Represents no value              |

### 🔍 Code Examples by Data Type

```python
# Integer
a = 100

# Float
pi = 3.1415

# String
language = "Python"

# Boolean
is_active = False

# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]

# Tuple
point = (10, 20)

# Dictionary
student = {"name": "Raj", "age": 21, "grade": "A"}

# Set
unique_nums = {1, 2, 3, 2}

# NoneType
result = None
```
---

### 🔁 Type Checking and Type Conversion

### 🔍 Checking Type:
Use `type()` function:
```python
a = 10
print(type(a))     # Output: <class 'int'>
```

### 🔁 Type Conversion (Type Casting):
```python
x = 5
print(float(x))    # Converts int to float => 5.0

y = "123"
print(int(y))      # Converts string to int => 123
```

---

### 💻 Code Examples

### Example 1: Basic Variables
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.5
is_student = True

print(name, age, height, is_student)
```

### Example 2: Changing Data Types
```python
x = 100
print(type(x))

x = "Now I'm a string"
print(type(x))
```

### Example 3: List, Tuple, Dict, Set
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 2}

print(my_list, my_tuple, my_dict, my_set)
```
---

### 📗 Common Operations by Type

```python
# String concatenation and repetition
greeting = "Hi " + "there!"
repeat = "Python " * 3

# Math with int and float
x = 5 + 2.5

# Boolean logic
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)  # False

# List operations
colors = ["red", "blue"]
colors.append("green")

# Dictionary access
profile = {"name": "Sara"}
print(profile["name"])

# Set usage
ids = {1, 2, 3}
ids.add(4)
```

### 🧠 Summary
- Variables are containers for storing data values.
- Python has multiple built-in data types.
- You can check and convert data types using built-in functions like `type()`, `int()`, `float()`, etc.
- Understanding variables and data types is the foundation of Python programming.


---
### 🚀 Advanced
### 💡 Check the memory location of a Variable
Use `id()` to check a variable’s memory location:

```python
x = 10
print(id(x))
```
---

## 💡 Think Deeper
- What happens under the hood when you do `a = b = [1,2,3]`?
