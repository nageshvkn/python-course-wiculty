# 🧠 Control Statements:
- ## `break`
- ## `continue`
- ## `pass`

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand how `break`, `continue`, and `pass` control the flow in loops.
- Learn the differences between them through examples.
- Identify where and why to use these statements in real-world logic.
- Practice with exercises and apply through mini-projects.

---

## 🧩 1. `break` Statement
The `break` statement is used to **exit a loop prematurely**, i.e., before the loop condition becomes False.

### 📌 Syntax
```python
for item in collection:
    if condition:
        break
 ```

---

## 🎯 Coding Examples - `break` Statement

---

### 🎯 Example 1: Exit on condition
```python
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        print("🔴 Breaking the loop at", i)
        break
    print("✅ i =", i)
```

---

### 🎯 Example 2: Using break in a while loop
```python
count = 0
while True:
    print("🔁 Count:", count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 3:
        print("🛑 Breaking the while loop")
        break
```

---

## 🧩 2. `continue` Statement
The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next cycle of the loop.

### 📌 Syntax
```python
for item in collection:
    if condition:
        continue
    # rest of the loop
```

---

## 🎯 Coding Examples - `continue` Statement

---

### 🎯 Example 1: Skipping even numbers
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print("✅ Odd number:", i)
```

---

### 🎯 Example 2: Skip negative inputs
```python
numbers = [3, -1, 7, -5, 8]
for num in numbers:
    if num < 0:
        continue
    print("🚀 Positive:", num)
```

---

## 🧩 3. `pass` Statement
The pass statement is a placeholder that does nothing. It's used when a statement is required syntactically but no code is to be executed.

### 📌 Syntax
```python
for item in collection:
    if condition:
        pass
```

---

## 🎯 Coding Examples - `pass` Statement

---

### 🎯 Example 1:  Placeholder for future code
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        pass  # TODO: add logic here later
    print("Looping:", i)
```

---

### 🎯 Example 2:  Empty function definition
```python
def future_function():
    pass  # implementation pending
```

## ✅ Summary Table: `break`, `continue`, and `pass` in Python

| Keyword   | Purpose                                                                 | Used Inside     | Effect on Loop Flow                             | Common Use Case Example                              |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `break`   | Immediately terminates the loop                                         | Loops (`for`, `while`) | Exits the loop when a condition is met             | Stop searching once an item is found                |
| `continue`| Skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration       | Loops           | Skips remaining loop body and jumps to next cycle | Skip processing invalid input or even numbers        |
| `pass`    | Does nothing (acts as a placeholder)                                    | Anywhere        | No effect, just syntactically valid empty block   | Writing empty functions or loops for future use     |
