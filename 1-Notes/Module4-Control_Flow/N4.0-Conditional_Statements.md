### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of conditional branching.
- Learn how to use `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` statements
- Write clean, readable, and logical decision-making code.
- Apply conditionals to build interactive programs.

---

## 🧠 What are **Conditonal Statements**

- In Python, **conditional statements** are used to execute code based on certain conditions. 
- Conditional statements allow Python programs to make decisions based on logic.  
- They control the flow of execution depending on whether a condition is `True` or `False`.

---

### 🎯 The `if` Statement
The `if` statement evaluates a condition and executes a block of code only if the condition is `True`.

Syntax:
```python
if condition:
    # Code block
```

---

### 🎯 The `if-else` Statement
The `else` clause allows you to define an alternative block if the condition is `False`.

Syntax:
```python
if condition:
    # Executed if True
else:
    # Executed if False
```

---

### 🎯 `if-elif-else` Statement
When you have multiple conditions, use `elif` (short for else-if). You can have multiple `elif` clauses.

Syntax:
```python
if condition1:
    # Executed if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Executed if condition2 is True
else:
    # Executed if none are True
```

## 🧪 Code Examples

---

### Example 1: Basic `if` Conditional Statement

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
```

---

### Example 2: `if-else`

```python
is_logged_in = False

if is_logged_in:
    print("Welcome back!")
else:
    print("Please log in to continue.")
```

---

### Example 3: `if-elif-else`

```python
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: D")
```

---

### Example 4: if with `in` membership operator
```python
email = "user@gmail.com"

if "@gmail.com" in email:
    print("Gmail account detected.")
```

---

### Example 5: if with `logical` operators
```python
username = "admin"
password = "admin123"

if username == "admin" and password == "admin123":
    print("Login successful.")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials.")
```

---

### Example 6: if with `not` and `or` logical operators
```python
is_online = False
battery_percent = 10

if not is_online or battery_percent < 20:
    print("Warning: Check system status or battery.")
```

---

### Example 7: Nested `if`
```python
balance = 5000
withdraw_amount = 2000

if balance >= withdraw_amount:
    if withdraw_amount <= 2500:
        print("Withdrawal successful.")
    else:
        print("Limit exceeded.")
else:
    print("Insufficient balance.")
```

---

### Example 8: # `One-liner if` (Ternary operator)
```python
age = 17
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status)
```

## ✅ Common Mistakes

| ❌ Mistake | 🧨 Why It's Wrong | ✅ Correct Usage |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Using `=` instead of `==` in conditions | `=` is assignment, not comparison | Use `==` for comparison |
| Forgetting colons `:` | Python uses `:` to start blocks | Always use `:` after `if`, `elif`, and `else` |
| Misusing indentation | Blocks won't run correctly | Use consistent 4-space indentation |

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Always use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Use parentheses for clarity in complex conditions
- Only one block in a chain executes
- Validate input before applying logic (Type cast if required)

---

## 💡 Think Deeper

- What happens if multiple elif conditions are True?
- Why is indentation critical in Python’s control flow?
