## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Understand what nested loops are and how they work.
- Learn how to use `for` and `while` loops inside another loop.
- Identify real-world use cases for nested loops.
- Practice writing clean and efficient nested loop code.
- Solve practical problems and implement mini projects using nested loops.

## 🧩 What Are Nested Loops?
A **nested loop** is a loop inside another loop. The outer loop runs its cycle, and for every single iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs completely.

---

## 📌 Syntax - `Nested for` loop
```python
for i in range(x):
    for j in range(y):
        # Code block
 ```

---

## 📌 Syntax - `Nested while` loop
```python
i = 0
while i < x:
    j = 0
    while j < y:
        # Code block
        j += 1
    i += 1
```

## 🧩 How Nested Loops Work?
Let’s say we want to print a grid:
```scss
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) 
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) 
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)
```

```python
# Code example
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(4):
        print(f"({i},{j})", end=" ")
    print()
```

## 🎯 Coding Examples - `Nested Loops`

---

### 🎯 Example 1:  Multiplication Table
```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    for j in range(1, 11):
        print(i * j, end="\t")
    print()
```

---

### 🎯 Example 2:  Pattern Printing
```python
rows = 5
for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(i + 1):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()
```

---

### 🎯 Example 3: Nested while Loop Example
```python
i = 1
while i <= 3:
    j = 1
    while j <= 3:
        print(f"{i}-{j}", end=" ")
        j += 1
    print()
    i += 1
```
