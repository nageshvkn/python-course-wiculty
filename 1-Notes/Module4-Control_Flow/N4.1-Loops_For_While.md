# 🌀 `while` and `for` Loops

---
## 📘 Overview:

- Loops are fundamental in programming. They allow us to repeat actions efficiently.
- Python provides two primary loop constructs: `while` and `for`.
- This chapter explores both in depth, with examples, exercises, and mini projects.

> #### 👨‍🏫 Trainer Note  
> - Try writing code that repeats actions **without** using a `for` loop (manual repetition).  
> - Then, use a `for` loop to perform the same actions/tasks **efficiently** and **repeatedly**.
---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the syntax and usage of `while` and `for` loops.
- Learn the differences between entry-controlled (`while`) and sequence-based (`for`) loops.
- Apply loops to automate repetitive tasks in code.
- Design and implement real-world logic using loops.

---

## 🔁 The `for` Loop
A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence like a list, tuple, dictionary, string, or range.

Basic Syntax:
```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code block to execute for each item
    print(variable)
```

---

### Example 1: range(start)
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints 0 to 4
```

---

### Example 2: range(start, stop)
Syntax:
```python
for i in range(2, 7):
    print(i)  # Prints 2 to 6
```

---

### Example 3: range(start, stop. step)
```python
for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i)  # Prints 10, 8, 6, 4, 2
```

---

> ### 🎯 Remember:
> **range(start, stop, step)**:
> - start: where to begin (inclusive)
> - stop: where to stop (exclusive)
> - step: increment/decrement

---

### Example 4: Loop over a String
```python
for char in "hello":
    print(char)
```

---

### Example 5: `Nested Loop` (Multiplication Table)
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        print(i * j, end="\t")
    print()
```

---

### Example 6: `for` Loop with `List`
```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
for name in names:
    print("Hello", name)
```

---

### Example 7: `for` Loop with `break`
```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break # Stops the loop immediately.
    print(i)
# Real-time Scenario: Exit loop early on error or condition.
```

---

### Example 8: `for` Loop with `continue`
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2: 
        continue # Skips the current iteration.
    print(i)
# Real-time Scenario: Skipping unavailable products in a list.
```

---

### Example 9: # `for` loop with `else`
Executes `else:` code block if the loop completes without break.
```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished without break.")

# Real-time Scenario: Loop all orders, then mark task as completed if no failures
```

---

### Example 10: # Looping over `files` in a directory
```python
# Looping over files in a directory (with os module)
import os
for filename in os.listdir("/path/to/folder"):
    print(filename)
```
---

### Example 11: List Comprehension (loop in `one line`)
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)
# Real-time Scenario: Data transformation before visualization.
```

---

> # The `while` Loop

---

## 🔁 What is a while Loop?
A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a given condition is `True`.
Use `while` loop, when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

```python
while condition:
    # Code block
```

---
## 🔁 Basic `while` loop
```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1 
    
    # Don't forget to update the loop variable, (i).
    # Otherwise, loop will become infinite.
```

**Key Points:**
- The condition is checked before entering the loop.
- There is a risk of infinite loop, if condition never becomes False.
- Make sure the loop progresses towards the termination condition to avoid infinite loops.

---

## 🔁 What is Infinite loop ?
- If the while condition is always `True`, the loop will run forever. This is called an infinite loop.

```python
while True:
    print("🔁 This will print forever!")
```

---

> ## 🔥 Risks of an Uncontrolled Infinite Loop
> - The program keeps executing the loop body repeatedly
> - CPU usage spikes: The loop runs as fast as possible, consuming cycles
> - Memory leaks: If the loop creates objects or opens files without cleanup
> - Disk I/O overload: If it writes to files or logs continuously
> - Network strain: If it sends requests or listens without throttling
> - You must use a break statement or external condition to stop it

---

## 🔍 What is Memory leaks?
A memory leak happens when a program allocates memory (e.g., creates objects, opens files) but fails to release it, even though it's no longer needed. Over time, this unused memory accumulates, leading to:

- Increased RAM usage
- Slower performance
- Potential crashes or system instability

---

## 🧪 Code Examples

---

### Example 1: Keep prompting a user until they provide a valid input.

```python
user_input = ""
while user_input.lower() != "yes":
    user_input = input("Do you agree? (yes to proceed): ")
print("Thank you for agreeing!")
```

- 🔁 You don’t know how many attempts the user will take.
- 🔁 for loop doesn’t suit here because there's no fixed number of iterations.

---

### Example 2: Menu-Driven Programs. Keep showing a menu until the user exits.

```python
choice = ""
while choice != "4":
    print("1. Add\n2. Subtract\n3. Multiply\n4. Exit")
    choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
    # Logic based on choice
```

- Useful in CLI tools, admin panels, ATM machines, etc.

---

### Example 3: Polling or Waiting for External Event

```python
import os
while not os.path.exists("data.csv"):
    print("Waiting for data.csv to be uploaded...")
```

- Wait until a file is created or a condition is met.
- Used in real-time systems, ETL pipelines, IoT systems, or monitoring.

---

### Example 4: Password Retry System

```python
password = "wiculty123"
attempts = 0
while attempts < 3:
    pwd = input("Enter password: ")
    if pwd == password:
        print("Access Granted")
        break
    else:
        print("Incorrect password")
        attempts += 1
```

- Allow limited login attempts
- `while` loop gives you flexibility to exit early if login is successful.

---

### Example 5: Game Loops

```python
game_running = True
while game_running:
    action = input("Enter move or type 'quit': ")
    if action == "quit":
        game_running = False
    else:
        print("You moved:", action)
```

- Keep game running until a quit condition
- Used in video games, simulations, chatbots, etc.

## 🧠 Summary: Differences Between while and for Loops

| Feature           | `while` Loop                                | `for` Loop                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Use Case**       | When the number of iterations is unknown     | When iterating over a sequence              |
| **Condition Check**| Before each iteration                        | Implicit via sequence                       |
| **Risk**           | Infinite loop if condition never becomes false | Less prone to infinite loops               |
| **Control**        | Manual incrementing                          | Automatic via sequence or `range()`         |
