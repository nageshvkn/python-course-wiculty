---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand what operator precedence means in Python
- Learn how associativity affects expression evaluation
- Predict the outcome of complex expressions using the precedence and associativity table
- Apply knowledge through examples, exercises, and a mini project

## 🧠 What is Operator Precedence?
Operator precedence determines **which operation is performed first** in an expression that has more than one operator.

Just like in mathematics:
```python
# Here, multiplication has higher precedence than addition

    result = 2 + 3 * 4  # Not (2 + 3) * 4 = 5 * 4 = 20
                        # But 3 * 4 = 12 → 2 + 12 = 14
```

---

## 🧠 What is Associativity?
Associativity defines the direction in which operations of the same precedence level are evaluated.

| Operator Type                | Direction of Evaluation         | Example                      |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Most operators               | Left-to-right (left associative)| `a - b - c` → `(a - b) - c`  |
| Exponentiation (`**`)        | Right-to-left (right associative)| `2 ** 3 ** 2` → `2 ** (3 ** 2)` |

Example:
```python
result = 2 ** 3 ** 2  # Exponentiation is right-associative
# 3 ** 2 = 9 --> 2 ** 9 = 512
# result = 512
```

## ✅ Operator Precedence Table (High to Low)

| Precedence Level | Operators                                      | Description                        | Associativity     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 (Highest)      | `()`                                           | Parentheses                        | —                 |
| 2                | `**`                                           | Exponentiation                     | Right to Left     |
| 3                | `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`                            | Multiplication, division, modulus  | Left to Right     |
| 4                | `+`, `-`                                       | Addition, subtraction              | Left to Right     |
| 5                | `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`               | Comparison operators               | Left to Right     |
| 6                | `in`, `not in`, `is`, `is not`                 | Membership and identity            | Left to Right     |

## ✅ Operator Precedence Table (High to Low)

| Precedence Level | Operators                                      | Description            | Associativity     |

| 10 (Lowest)      | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`, `**=`| Assignment operators   | Right to Left     |

## 🧪 3. Code Examples

---

### Example 1: Precedence Without Parentheses

```python
result = 10 + 2 * 3
print(result)  # Output: 16 (Multiplication before addition)
```

---


### Example 2: Precedence With Parentheses
```pytho
result = (10 + 2) * 3
print(result)  # Output: 36 (Addition first due to parentheses)
```

---

### Example 3: Associativity of Exponentiation
```python
result = 2 ** 3 ** 2
print(result)  # Output: 512 (evaluated as 2 ** (3 ** 2))
```

---

### Example 4:  Logical Operators
```python
x = True
y = False
z = True

print(x or y and z)  # Output: True (AND evaluated before OR)
```

---

## ❗ Common Mistakes

- Assuming `+` happens before `*` because it's written earlier.
- Forgetting to use parentheses to control evaluation.
- Misunderstanding associativity in expressions like `2 ** 3 ** 2`.

---

## 📌 Summary

- Operator precedence determines evaluation order
- Associativity determines direction of evaluation
- Use parentheses to clarify complex logic
- Parentheses override default precedence
- Avoid writing expressions that rely on obscure precedence rules
