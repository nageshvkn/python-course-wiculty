## 📖 What Are Arithmetic Operators?

Arithmetic operators are used to perform **basic mathematical operations** in Python. These include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

---

## 🧠 List of Arithmetic Operators

| Operator        | Symbol | Description                   | Example      | Output |
|-----------------|--------|-------------------------------|--------------|--------|
| Addition        | `+`    | Adds two values               | `5 + 3`      | `8`    |
| Subtraction     | `-`    | Subtracts right from left     | `9 - 4`      | `5`    |
| Multiplication  | `*`    | Multiplies two values         | `6 * 3`      | `18`   |
| Division        | `/`    | Divides left by right (float) | `10 / 4`     | `2.5`  |
| Floor Division  | `//`   | Division without decimal      | `10 // 4`    | `2`    |
| Modulus         | `%`    | Returns remainder             | `10 % 4`     | `2`    |
| Exponentiation  | `**`   | Raises power                  | `2 ** 3`     | `8`    |

---

## 🧪 Code Examples

### ➕ Addition and Subtraction

```python
a = 10
b = 5

print("Addition:", a + b)      # 15
print("Subtraction:", a - b)   # 5
```

---

### ✖️ Multiplication and Division

```python
x = 7
y = 2

print("Multiplication:", x * y)   # 14
print("Division:", x / y)         # 3.5
```

> 🧠 **Note on Division**
> - `/` always returns a **float**.  
> - `//` returns an **integer** (floor value).
> - Example:  
>   - `10 / 3` → `3.333...`  
>   - `10 // 3` → `3`

---

### ➗ Floor Division and Modulus
Modulus operator `%` returns the remainder from division

```python
a = 17
b = 4

print("Floor Division:", a // b)   # 4
print("Division:", a / b)          # 4.25
print("Modulus:", a % b)           # 1
```

---

### 🔼 Exponentiation

```python
base = 3
power = 4

print("Exponentiation:", base ** power)  # 81
```

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes

| Mistake                    | What Happens                  | How to Fix                  |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `10 / 0`                   | Raises `ZeroDivisionError`    | Never divide by zero        |
| Using `//` expecting float | Gives `int` result            | Use `/` for float result    |
| Using `^` instead of `**`  | `^` is bitwise XOR, not power | Use `**` for exponentiation |

### 💡 Think Deeper

#### 1️⃣ Operator Precedence in Python

Python evaluates expressions based on **operator precedence** (priority).  
Here’s the order you should remember:

| 🏆 Precedence Level | ⚡ Operator(s)                | 📝 Description                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣ (highest)      | `**`                         | Exponentiation                      |
| 2️⃣                | `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`          | Multiplication, Division, Modulus   |
| 3️⃣ (lowest)       | `+`, `-`                     | Addition, Subtraction               |

**🧩 Task:**  
Take three numbers from the user and compute `a + b * c ** 2`.

**❓ Question:**  
What is the order in which Python evaluates this expression?

---

**🔍 Explanation:**  
Python follows *operator precedence* to decide which operation to perform first.  
For the expression `a + b * c ** 2`:

1. `**` (Exponentiation) is evaluated first: `c ** 2`
2. `*` (Multiplication) is next: `b * (result of c ** 2)`
3. `+` (Addition) is last: `a + (result of b * c ** 2)`

---

**💡 Example:**
```python
a = 2
b = 3
c = 4
result = a + b * c ** 2
print(result)  # Output: 50
# Steps: c ** 2 = 16, b * 16 = 48, a + 48 = 50

```
