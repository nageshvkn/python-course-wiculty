### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand what Membership Operators are
- Learn how `in` and `not in` are used in Python
- Explore various data types that support membership testing
- Apply the concept through exercises and a mini project

## 🧠 What Are Membership Operators?

Membership operators are used to **test whether a value exists** within a **sequence type object**, such as:
- **String**
- **List**
- **Tuple**
- **Set**
- **Dictionary**

### ✅ Membership Operators In Python

Python provides two membership operators:

| Operator   | Description                                 | Example               |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `in`       | Returns `True` if value is present           | `'a' in 'apple'`       |
| `not in`   | Returns `True` if value is **not** present   | `'x' not in 'apple'`   |

These operators work with:

- Strings  
- Lists  
- Tuples  
- Sets  
- Dictionaries (keys only)

---

## 📌 Syntax

```python
element in sequence
element not in sequence
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code Examples

---

### ✅ Membership in Strings
```python
text = "hello world"

print("h" in text)       # True
print("z" not in text)   # True
```

---

### ✅ Membership in Lists
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("banana" in fruits)      # True
print("grape" not in fruits)   # True
```

---

### ✅ Membership in Tuples
```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")

print("green" in colors)       # True
```

---

### ✅ Membership in Sets
```python
ids = {101, 102, 103}

print(102 in ids)              # True
```

---

### ✅ Membership in Dictionaries (keys only)
```python
user = {"name": "Nagesh", "role": "admin"}

print("name" in user)          # True
print("admin" in user)         # False  # 'admin' is a value, not a key
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistake

| ❌ Mistake                          | 🧨 Why It’s Wrong                                          | ✅ Correct Usage                      |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `if 5 in 12345`                   | `12345` is an integer, not a sequence                      | `'5' in '12345'` or `5 in [1,2,3,4,5]` |

---

### 🧠 Summary

- `in` and `not in` check presence or absence in sequence types
- Works with strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- Useful for input validation, search, filtering, and access control ..etc.
