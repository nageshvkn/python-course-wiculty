# 🔤 Logical Operators In Python

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand what logical operators are and why they are used.
- Learn the three main logical operators in Python: `and`, `or`, and `not`.
- Apply logical operators in decision-making and conditions.
- Avoid common mistakes in using logical operators.
- Practice with exercises and apply learning through a mini-project.

## 📘 What are Logical Operators?

Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements. They return Boolean values (`True` or `False`) and are essential for decision-making in programs.

They are typically used in **decision-making** (like in `if` statements), and allow for **compound conditions**.

## 🧮 Types of Logical Operators in Python

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `and`    | Logical AND | Returns `True` if **both** expressions are `True` | `x > 10 and x < 20` |
| `or`     | Logical OR  | Returns `True` if **at least one** expression is `True` | `x > 10 or x == 5` |
| `not`    | Logical NOT | Reverses the result — `True` becomes `False` and vice versa | `not (x > 10)` |

## 🔍 Logical Operator Truth Tables

---

### ✅ `and` Operator Truth Table

| A     | B     | A `and` B |
|-------|-------|---------|
| True  | True  | True    |
| True  | False | False   |
| False | True  | False   |
| False | False | False   |

---

### ✅ `or` Operator Truth Table

| A     | B     | A `or` B |
|-------|-------|--------|
| True  | True  | True   |
| True  | False | True   |
| False | True  | True   |
| False | False | False  |
---

### ✅ `not` Operator Truth Table

| A     | `not` A |
|-------|-------|
| True  | False |
| False | True  |

## 🧑‍💻 Code Examples

---

### Example 1: Using `and` Logical Operator
```python
age = 25
if age > 18 and age < 30:
    print("Eligible for the program")
```

---

### Example 2: Using `or` Logical Operator
```
has_passport = False
has_driver_license = True

if has_passport or has_driver_license:
    print("You can travel domestically")
```

---

### Example 3: Using `not` Logical Operator
```python
is_logged_in = False

if not is_logged_in:
    print("Please log in to continue")
```

---

### Example 4: Combining multiple operators
```python
score = 85
if (score > 80 and score < 90) or (score == 100):
    print("Great job!")
```

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

---

### 1. Using `&` or `|` Instead of `and`  `or`
```python
# WRONG
if a > 10 & b < 5:  # Bitwise operator!
```

---

### 2. Forgetting parentheses in complex conditions
```python
# Confusing order
if not a > 10 and b < 5:
    # NOT applies only to a > 10, not whole condition
```

---

### 3. Using strings or integers in logical expressions without understanding truthy/falsy values
```python
if "hello" and 0:
    print("Will not print because 0 is False")
```

---

### 🧠 Summary
- **and**: All conditions must be True
- **or**: At least one condition must be True
- **not**: Reverses the truth value
- Always use parentheses () to clarify complex logical expressions.
