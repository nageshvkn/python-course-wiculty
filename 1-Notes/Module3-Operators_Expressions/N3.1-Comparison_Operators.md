# üî§ Comparison Operators In Python

---

### üéØ Learning Objectives
- Understand what comparison operators are.
- Learn how to use them in real-world expressions.
- Practice comparison logic using examples and exercises.
- Build a mini project using comparison operators.

---

### üß† What are Comparison Operators?

Comparison operators are used to **compare two values**. The result of a comparison is always a **Boolean**: `True` or `False`.

These operators are used in:

- Conditional statements (`if`, `while`)
- Looping with logic
- Validating input

---

### test Program
```java
public class Test
{
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hellow World!")
    }
}
```

### üî∏ List of Comparison Operators in Python

| Operator | Description                  | Example       | Result     |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------|------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                     | `5 == 5`      | `True`     |
| `!=`     | Not equal to                 | `5 != 3`      | `True`     |
| `>`      | Greater than                 | `7 > 2`       | `True`     |
| `<`      | Less than                    | `3 < 8`       | `True`     |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to     | `5 >= 5`      | `True`     |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to        | `4 <= 3`      | `False`    |

### üß™ Code Examples

---

#### ‚úÖ Basic Comparison
```python
x = 10
y = 5

print(x == y)   # False
print(x != y)   # True
print(x > y)    # True
print(x < y)    # False
print(x >= y)   # True
print(x <= y)   # False
```
> üß† **Note:** Comparison operations always result in `True` or `False`.  
> These Boolean values are used in if, while ..etc. control flow statements to drive the flow (i.e to decide whether to execute a block of code or not) or be stored in variables.

---

#### ‚úÖ Comparison in if Conditionsl Statement
```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

---

#### ‚úÖ Using Comparison in a Function

```python
def is_even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0

print(is_even(4))  # True
print(is_even(5))  # False
```

---

#### üîç Comparison Between Data Types
Python allows comparisons across numeric types (int, float)

```python
print(5 == 5.0)     # True
print(7 < 7.1)      # True
print(3 >= 3.0)     # True
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Comparing different types like int vs str leads to error

```python
print(5 == "5")     # False (types differ)
```
---

### üîπ Chained Comparisons
Python supports chained comparisons like:

```python
x = 5
print(1 < x < 10)   # True

# Equivalent to: 1 < x and x < 10
```

---

#### ‚úÖ User Authorization Check

```python
username = input("Enter username: ")
if username != "":
    print("Welcome,", username)
else:
    print("Please provide a username.")
```

### ‚ùó Common Mistakes

| Mistake                  | What Happens                                 | How to Fix                           |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `=` instead of `==`      | Assignment instead of comparison             | Use `==` for comparison              |
| Comparing different types| Can return `False` or throw an error         | Convert types before comparing       |
| Chaining wrongly         | `5 < x < 10` works in Python, not in all langs | Write clearly for readability       |

---

### üß† Summary
- Comparison operators return True or False.
- Common operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.
- Often used in conditional statements and loops.
- Be careful not to confuse = (assignment) with == (comparison).
- Python supports chained comparisons: 10 < x < 20.

---

## üí° Think Deeper
1. Why does 10 == 10.0 return True but 10 == "10" return False?
2. Can chained comparisons reduce code repetition? Show examples.
