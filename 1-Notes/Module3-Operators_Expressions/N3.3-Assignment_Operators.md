# 🔤 Assignment Operators In Python

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand what assignment operators are and why they are used.
- Learn different types of assignment operators in Python.
- Practice using them through examples and exercises.
- Apply concepts through a mini project.

---

## 📘 What are Assignment Operators?
- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.  
- They are also used to **perform operations** like addition or multiplication and **assign the result** back to the same variable.
- These operators are **shorthand notations** that reduce repetitive code.
- Assignment operators combine assignment (`=`) with other operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

### ✅ Common Assignment Operators in Python

| Operator | Description                        | Example         | Equivalent To       |
|----------|------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| `=`      | Assigns value                      | `x = 5`          | —                   |
| `+=`     | Adds and assigns                   | `x += 3`         | `x = x + 3`         |
| `-=`     | Subtracts and assigns              | `x -= 2`         | `x = x - 2`         |
| `*=`     | Multiplies and assigns             | `x *= 4`         | `x = x * 4`         |
| `/=`     | Divides and assigns (float)        | `x /= 2`         | `x = x / 2`         |
| `//=`    | Floor divides and assigns          | `x //= 2`        | `x = x // 2`        |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assigns                | `x %= 3`         | `x = x % 3`         |
| `**=`    | Exponentiates and assigns          | `x **= 2`        | `x = x ** 2`        |

## 🧑‍💻 Code Examples

---

### ✅ Basic Assignment (`=`) Operator
```python
x = 10
print(x)  # Output: 10
```

---

### ✅ Addition Assignment (+=) Operator
```python
x = 5
x += 3  # same as x = x + 3
print(x)  # Output: 8
```

---

### ✅ Subtraction Assignment (-=) Operator
```python
x = 10
x -= 4
print(x)  # Output: 6
```

---

### ✅ Multiplication Assignment (*=) Operator
```python
x = 3
x *= 4
print(x)  # Output: 12
```

---

### ✅ Division Assignment (/=) Operator
```
x = 20
x /= 5
print(x)  # Output: 4.0
```
---

### ✅ Modulus Assignment (%=) Operator
```python
x = 10
x %= 3
print(x)  # Output: 1
```

---

### ✅  Exponent Assignment (**=) Operator
```python
x = 2
x **= 3  # 2^3 = 8
print(x)  # Output: 8
```

---

### 🧠 Summary
- Assignment operators simplify updates a variable.
- Use +=, -=, etc., to reduce redundancy.
- Be careful with types (like float after /=).

---

## 💡 Think Deeper
- What happens when you use assignment operators with different data types (e.g., strings, lists)?
